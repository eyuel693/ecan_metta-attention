# Optimizations and Fixes

- **Fixed KeyboardInterrupt Handling in ParallelScheduler**: The previous implementation of `run_continuously()` did not properly handle cleanup when interrupted. This led to threads remaining active or in an inconsistent state. The issue was resolved by adding a `finally` block to ensure proper thread cleanup and graceful shutdown when the system is interrupted.

- **Improved Error Handling in AgentObject**: The `__call__` method in `AgentObject` assumed that the `metta` call would always succeed. However, this could cause the program to crash when certain conditions were not met. This was addressed by adding error handling and logging to the `__call__` method, ensuring that failures are captured, logged, and handled gracefully without affecting the overall execution.

- **Added Synchronization in ParallelScheduler**: To address the concurrent access issue that caused crashes when multiple agents tried to access the shared atomspace simultaneously, synchronization mechanisms were introduced. This ensures that agents do not conflict when accessing shared resources, preventing errors such as "already borrowed: BorrowMutError" in the MeTTa runtime.


```
try:
    print("\nRunning agents in continuous mode. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
    scheduler.run_continuously()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nReceived interrupt signal. Stopping system...")
finally:
    # Ensure all threads are cleaned up and the system shuts down gracefully
    scheduler.cleanup()

```

- **AgentObject Synchronization**: In addition to ParallelScheduler synchronization, the `AgentObject` class was modified to include synchronization, further reducing the risk of concurrent access issues.

- **Concurrency Optimization**: To prevent contention, we limited the concurrent execution to one agent at a time by setting `max_workers=1`. This was done in combination with adding small delays between agent executions to reduce resource contention and improve the overall stability of the system.
```

class AgentObject:
    def __call__(self):
        try:
            # Attempt to call the metta method
            self.metta.some_method()
        except Exception as e:
            # Log the error and provide useful debug information
            print(f"Error in AgentObject __call__: {e}")
            # Optionally log to a file for persistent tracking
            # logger.error(f"Error in AgentObject __call__: {e}")

```
